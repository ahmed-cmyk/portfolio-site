# Portfolio Site

A minimal, fast, and framework-free portfolio site built with progressive enhancement in mind.

This site avoids bloated modern frameworks in favor of small, composable tools like [htmx](https://htmx.org), keeping performance and simplicity as top priorities.

## Philosophy

This project reflects my personal preference for:

- âœ… Simplicity over complexity  
- âš¡ Speed over trendiness  
- ðŸ§± HTML-first, progressively enhanced development  
- ðŸ§° Small tools with clear purpose over large monoliths

## Project Structure

```

/
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html         # Main entry point
â”œâ”€â”€ about.html         # Additional content pages
â”œâ”€â”€ css/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ style.css      # Custom styles (can include Tailwind via CDN if needed)
â””â”€â”€ js/                # Optional scripts

````

## Getting Started

No build step required. Just open `index.html` in your browser or serve with a static file server:

```bash
# using Python 3
python3 -m http.server

# or using Node
npx serve
````

---

## Tools Used

* [htmx](https://htmx.org) â€“ Load content dynamically using plain HTML and attributes

---

## Why Not a Framework?

Modern JavaScript frameworks like React or Svelte are powerful, but they often add unnecessary complexity and JavaScript overhead for static sites or content-driven projects.

This site embraces a simpler model â€” where HTML does most of the work.
